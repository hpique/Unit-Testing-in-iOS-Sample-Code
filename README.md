Sample code for my talk about [Unit Testing in iOS](http://www.slideshare.net/robotmedia/unit-testing-in-i-os-15491405).

ColorTouch is a sample app to demonstrate how to integrate OCUnit, [GHUnit](http://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit) and [OCMock](http://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock).

It comes in two flavours:

ColorTouch1
===========

How *not* to write testable code plus a bare-bones OCUnit test.

ColorTouch2
===========

Same functionality, more testable code. Includes OCUnit tests, a GHUnit target and a OCMock example.
